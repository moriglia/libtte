This repository is a MATLAB function package I'm using for the
Teletraffic Engineering Course at University of Pisa.

## Usage
Clone the repository into a folder with a leading "+":
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moriglia/libtte.git +libtte
```
Note that the "+"" character in the folder name is essential for MATLAB to recognize a package.

Refer to the functions you need in this way:
```MATLAB
>> libtte.mytest(1)
ans =

    2
```
